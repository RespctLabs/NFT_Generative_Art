Notes: 

1. **Flexibility** :  To have flexibility with a layer, we can add a blank png file so that in some of the output images, that layer is absent. For example, in eyewear, we can have a blank png file for no eyewears.

2. **Implementing Rarity:** We can make a trait rare by the naming convention:  
Example: Background Layer: "blue #1" and "white #100" blue is a more rare trait, and hence its price would be higher. the numbers after the hashtags are like the weights of that trait. The lesser the rarer. 

If for a layer, we want every trait to be equal, we can just name them "black", "white", i.e., without hashtags.
